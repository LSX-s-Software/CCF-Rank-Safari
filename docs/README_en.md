# CCF-Rank-Safari

A **Safari** extension to show conference/journal ranks on the paper search results page.

Currently supports displaying CCF(China Computer Federation) ranks on Springer, DBLP, IEEExplore, and ACM DL.

> This repository is based on [hnshhslsh/show-rank](https://github.com/hnshhslsh/show-rank).

## Introduction

- When searching for papers on the supported sites, the CCF rankings of conferences/journals are automatically placed before the sources and marked with different colors.

- If the abbreviation of the conference/journal can be found in the ranking database, but the full name does not match, a question mark `?` will be displayed after the ranking. When the mouse is hovering over a ranking with a question mark, the full name of the conference/journal corresponding to the abbreviation of this ranking will be displayed for inspection.

- When the mouse is hovering over a ranking without a question mark, the recognized meeting/journal name will be displayed for inspection.
